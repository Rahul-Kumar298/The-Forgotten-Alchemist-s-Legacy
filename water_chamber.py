intro = "The Aqua Maze is a twisting, submerged tunnel system with water rushing from dark hole to larger cavern and echoing all around. This chamber is imbued with ancient water-based magic; flooded passageways will test your movement, fluid riddles will frustrate you and the powerful control over water currents is elegantly delivered to players only through tidal grasp. But let one beware the moving paths of the maze, where even the walls seem to flow and whisper dead words soring forikinity beached along all hidden key with great Ares-cunning kepsdense."
